# longitudinal-suvr
CS cluster scripts for midpoint pairwise longitudinal reg with SPM, then voxel mapping using the deformation fields (and previous MR to PET rigid reg), to extract PET uptake from each voxel pair, run least-trimmed squares regression on the pairs to find outliers and finally make outlier binary mask for each PET image.
